	abstract = {Stochastic processes are mathematical models of random phenomena in time evolution. Lévy processes are stochastic processes whose increments in nonoverlapping time intervals are independent and whose increments are stationary in time. Further we assume a weak continuity called stochastic continuity. They constitute a fundamental class of stochastic processes. Brownian motion, Poisson processes, and stable processes are typical Lévy processes. After Paul Lévy's characterization in the 1930s of all processes in this class, many researches have revealed properties of their distributions and behaviors of their sample functions. However, Lévy processes are rich mathematical objects, still furnishing attractive problems of their own. On the other hand, important classes of stochastic processes are obtained as generalizations of the class of Lévy processes. One of them is the class of Markov processes; another is the class of semimartingales. The study of Lévy processes serves as the foundation for the study of stochastic processes. Dropping the stationarity requirement of increments for Lévy processes, we get the class of additive processes. The distributions of Lévy and additive processes at any time are infinitely divisible, that is, they have the nth roots in the convolution sense for any n. When a time is fixed, the class of Lévy processes is in one-to-one correspondence with the class of infinitely divisible distributions. Additive processes are described by systems of infinitely divisible distributions. This book is intended to provide comprehensive basic knowledge of Lévy processes, additive processes, and infinitely divisible distributions with detailed proofs and, at the same time, to serve as an introduction to stochastic processes. As we deal with the simplest stochastic processes, we do not assume any knowledge of stochastic processes with a continuous parameter. Prerequisites for this book are of the level of the textbook of Billingsley [27] or that of Chung [70]. Making an additional assumption of selfsixnilarity or some extensions of it on Lévy or additive processes, we get certain important processes. Such are stable processes, semi-stable processes, and selfsimilar additive processes. We give them systematic study. Correspondingly, stable, semistable, and selfdecomposable distributions are treated. On the other hand

PREFACE the class of Levy processes contains processes quite different from selfsimilar, and intriguing time evolution in distributional properties appears. There are ten chapters in this book. They can be divided into three parts. Chapters 1 and 2 constitute the basic part. Essential examples and a major tool for the analysis are given in Chapter 1. The tool is to consider Fourier transforms of probability measures, called characteristic functions. Then, in Chapter 2, characterization of all infinitely divisible distributions is given. They give description of all Lévy processes and also of all additive processes. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are the second part. They develop fundamental results on which subsequent chapters rely. Chapter 3 introduces selfsimilarity and other structures. Chapter 4 deals with decomposition of sample functions into jumps and continuous motions. Chapter 5 is on distributional properties. The third part ranges from Chapter 6 to Chapter 10. They are nearly independent of each other and treat major topics on Lévy processes such as subordination and density transformation, recurrence and transience, potential theory, Wiener-Hopf factorizations, and unimodality and multimodality. We do not touch extensions of Lévy processes and infinitely divisible distributions connected with Lie groups, hypergroups, and generalized convolutions. There are many applications of Lévy processes to stochastic integrals, branching processes, and measure-valued processes, but they are not included in this book. Risk theory, queueing theory, and stochastic finance are active fields where Lévy processes often appear. The original version of this book is Kahou katei written in Japanese, published by Kinokuniya at the end of 1990. The book is enlarged and material is rewritten. Many recent advances are included and a new chapter on potential theory is added. Exercises are now given to each chapter and their solutions are at the end of the volume. For many years I have been happy in collaborating with Makoto Yamazato and Toshiro Watanabe. I was encouraged by Takeyuki Hida and Hiroshi Kunita to write the original Japanese book and the present book. Frank Knight and Toshiro Watanabe read through the manuscript and gave me numerous suggestions for correction of errors and improvement of presentation. Kazuyuki Inoue, Mamoru Kanda, Makoto Maejima, Yumiko Sato, Masaaki Tsuchiya, and Makoto Yamazato pointed out many inaccuracies to be eliminated. Part of the book was presented in lectures at the University of Zurich [405] as arranged by Masao Nagasawa. The preparation of this book was made in AMSLaTeX; Shinta Sato assisted me with the computer. My heartfelt thanks go to all of them.},
